" Download the following scripts and place them in your Vim plugin directory:
" 
"     clipbrd.vim
"     genutils.vim
"     multvals.vim 
" 
" The vbscript below should be saved as something like runvim.vbs and put it in a directory such as C:\Program Files\Vim\Vim63. Modify the run line to show the correct path to your gvim executable. Create a shortcut to runvim.vbs on your desktop. Right-click on the shortcut, select "Properties" from the context menu, click the "Shortcut" tab and add a "Shortcut Key" â€“ something like "Ctrl-Alt-V".
